    <h1>About All One People</h1>
    <p>
        All One People is an entirely volunteer organization dedicated to "Lifting, Educating, and 
        Inspiring Africa's Youth". No one in our organization draws a salary. We use our available time 
        to coordinate projects in Kenya and raise funds at home to support the work there. All of us 
        dedicate not only our time but much of our personal money to support our youth in Kenya.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight-box">
        If you join us by giving to All One People projects we promise to make the best possible use of 
        your money. Since we are all volunteers, we can promise that approximately <strong>97% of your 
        donation will reach the children</strong>. We value your donation and promise to make it count 
        for good.

            <p class="member-title">Vice President</p>
            <p>
                Vickie is the mother of six children and a volunteer at heart. She has served in many 
                positions of leadership in the schools, community, and church. Her heart was drawn to the 
                Kenyan people, particularly the youth, during her trip in November 2009 when she traveled 
                with All One People. There she met wonderful people at the Lillywhite Education Center and 
                many deserving youth from the Nairobi area who desperately need financial aid to complete 
                their high school education.
