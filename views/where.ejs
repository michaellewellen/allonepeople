        <h1>Where We Work</h1>
        <p>
            All One People is currently working in Kenya, East Africa. Kenya is located on the equator 
            and the east coast of Africa. It is a land with a pleasant climate but challenging economic 
            and educational conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Poverty is common, gripping the lives of millions of bright and capable youth, crushing 
            their dreams of a better life. Education is widely available but beginning in high school 
            is expensive. Most high schools are boarding schools, requiring expensive tuition and fees. 
            Many families simply cannot afford high school and children are forced to give up cherished 
            dreams of gaining an education and escape from poverty.

        <h2>Our Focus in Kenya</h2>
        <p>
            Here in Kenya, All One People works to help underprivileged children attend high school. 
            We also provide support to an orphanage, The Lillywhite Education Center for Orphans.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can divide our focus into two areas: first, the children and high school students of 
            the Lillywhite Education Center for Orphans and second, underprivileged high school students 
            in Nairobi.
