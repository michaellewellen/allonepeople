            It is also our mission to make the best possible use of funds donated to All One People. 
            Since we are an entirely volunteer organization, approximately <strong>97% of all donations 
            reach the children</strong>. We will not deduct administrative expenses, wages, or travel 
            costs from your donation.
        </p>
        <p class="mission-statement">
            Our mission is to lift Africa's youth from poverty and despair to prosperity and hope, 
            inspiring them to be productive citizens and future leaders. We do this by ensuring that 
            students receive a high school education. This opens the door to future progress that 
            otherwise would not be possible.

            <p>
                For needy young Kenyans, a chasm exists between free primary school (grades 1–8) and 
                university/college education. That chasm is high school, with its required tuition and 
                other costs. Many students must leave school after eighth grade because they cannot pay 
                tuition.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we help by bridging that gap, we transform a deserving youth from a school drop-out 
                into a contributing adult who will provide leadership in the community and church. These 
                students understand what education means—not just for themselves, but for their families 
                and communities. Your donation doesn't just change a life. It changes a trajectory.
            </p>

                The investment is small. The impact is generational.
